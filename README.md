## üë®‚Äçüíª About this project

Ultra Verde is a blog written by Baltazar Guti√©rrez founder of the fans team Ultra Verde where he shares his stories supporting the Club Le√≥n (team of Mexican football) for more than 40 years.

I did this project to resume my learning with Nuxt 3, a framework of Vue JS, in addition to implementing Nuxt Content with Markdown for the structure of blog.
